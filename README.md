# Apple Developer App Discover Page

## Introduction
I had a sudden inspiration and spent half a day creating this small sample project. My company primarily uses Objective-C for development, and the company's app supports iOS versions starting from 11.0. Due to my limited experience with Objective-C and UIKit (as I am more familiar with SwiftUI), and my admiration for the Apple Developer App interface, I created this sample program to improve my skills in both Objective-C and the UIKit framework.

This example is a simple UI construction that does not use Storyboards; instead, all interface elements are created programmatically. Additionally, this program does not include network interface requests; all data is hardcoded within the code.

Finally, since I only spent half a day on this project, the code may not be very polished. I welcome any suggestions for optimization or new feature additions. Please feel free to submit a pull request on GitHub. Thank you in advance for your contributions!

## System Require
- iOS 13.0+ (At first I want to support iOS 11.0+ but I really really want to use SF Symbols...)
- Xcode 15.0+
- CocoaPods
